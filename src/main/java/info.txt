I have used jaxb for this project.This library allows me to marshal and unmarshal xml files
to POJOS.I have created an input and output folder , basically the orders that are added in the input folder
are processed by the application, and then all the products that are on them are selected and added to sepparate files
which are added to the output folder.Because of lack of time i miss the following functionalities:

1)I hardcoded the suppliers to only 3.If more time was available i could have created a dynamic way of adding suppliers
to the application , and an interactive menu.

2)My products are not sorted based on time.

3)The string parsing for order name is also hardcoded so if we go above "Order99" the substring will not work correctly anymore.

4)Only 3 files are outputed for all the vendors containing all the products from the orders in the input folder,
it should have been ex Order01.xml -> panasonic01.xml;Order02.xml ->panasonic02.xml etc.

All in all it was an interesting project, and the first time i have worked with jaxb.I believe i learned how to automate
alot of the boring stuff by doing this small project.
